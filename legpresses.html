    <br><h3>What Is a Leg Press?</h3><br>
    <p>A leg press is an isolation exercise that targets muscle groups throughout your lower body, including your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. 
        Practice leg presses by sitting against the backrest of a leg press machine. Place your feet against the footplate with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle. 
        Slowly push against the footplate to move a pulley attached to weight plates. Return the footplate to its original position and repeat for the desired amount of repetitions.</p><br>
    <hr><h3>2 Types of Leg Presses</h3><br>
    <p>There are two main types of leg presses you can practice</p><br>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Horizontal leg press:</b>Perform this variation by using a horizontal leg press machine, sitting upright, and pushing the footplate away from your body.</li><br>
        <li>Incline leg press: Practice this variation by using a leg press machine at a 45-degree angle. 
            You can generally press more weight in this position, but it puts slightly more strain on your lower back.</li><br>
    </ol><hr>
    <h3>How to Do a Leg Press With Proper Form</h3><br>
    <p>For the leg press, begin by using a weight that you can control for 2-3 sets of 8-15 repetitions. 
        Choose a weight that allows you to maintain good technique throughout all sets and repetitions.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sit on the leg press machine with your back against the back pad and your head rested on the head pad.</li><br>
        <li>Place your feet on the resistance plate. Your feet should be hip-width or slightly wider than hip-width apart. Your entire foot should be in contact with the resistance plate,
             with emphasis on maintaining heel contact. Your legs should be at a 90-degree angle</li><br>
        <li>Grab the handles with a light grip to stabilize your upper body.</li><br>
        <li>Engage your core and unrack the weight.</li><br>
        <li>Straighten your legs to move the weight off of the weight stack. Your legs should be outstretched with a slight bend in your knees, and your shoulders should be over your hips.</li><br>
        <li>While maintaining your alignment, begin the downward movement by slowly bending your hips and knees.</li><br>
        <li> Lower until your legs form a 90-degree angle. The weight on your feet should be evenly distributed, with emphasis on your heels to keep your feet flat.</li><br>
        <li>Pause for a second at the bottom position.</li><br>
        <li>To begin the upward movement, push your feet into the resistance plate. Place emphasis on pushing through your midfoot and heels while keeping your toes engaged.</li><br>
        <li>At the end of each repetition, your legs should be outstretched with a slight bend in your knees.</li>
    </ol>

    <hr><h3>Pros and Cons of Doing Leg Presses</h3><br>
    <p>Incorporating leg presses into your strength training program can have several benefits:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Leg presses isolate your leg muscles.</b> The leg press targets muscles in your leg to help increase your lower body strength. However, your stabilizer muscles are inactive during the exercise, 
            meaning you won't work your lower back muscles, adductors, and core as much as you would during a squat exercise.</li><br>
        <li><b>Leg presses are easily adjustable.</b> Change which leg muscles you target by changing your foot placement. If your foot position is lower on the footplate, your quads will be prioritized. 
            For more hamstring and glute activation, place your feet lower on the footplate. Adjust the weight plates on the machine according to your fitness level.</li><br>
        <li><b>Leg presses are a beginner-level leg exercise.</b> If you need an easy way to begin developing your leg muscles, the leg press is a good place to start. With practice, 
            leg presses can help develop your leg strength to support you during more challenging compound exercises like deadlifts and back squats</li><br>
        <li><b>Leg presses use a shorter range of motion than squats.</b> Squats use a functional movement pattern that allows your hips, knees, and ankles to go through a greater range of motion than leg presses.</li><br>
        <li><b>Leg presses require equipment.</b> If you don't have access to a leg press machine, consider practicing a different leg exercise in your home 
            gym like a weighted squat variation using free weights such as a barbell, kettlebell, or a pair of dumbbells.</li>

    <h3>How to Work out Safely and Avoid Injury</h3><br>
    <p>If you have a previous or pre-existing health condition, consult your physician before beginning an exercise program. Proper exercise technique is essential to ensure the safety and effectiveness of an exercise program, 
        but you may need to modify each exercise to attain optimal results based on your individual needs. Always select a weight that allows you to have full control of your body throughout the movement. 
        When performing any exercise, pay close attention to your body, and stop immediately if you note pain or discomfort.</p><br>
    <p>In order to see continual progress and build body strength, incorporate proper warm-ups, rest, and nutrition into your exercise program. Your results will ultimately be based on your ability to adequately 
        recover from your workouts. Rest for 24 to 48 hours before training the same muscle groups to allow sufficient recovery.</p><br>
