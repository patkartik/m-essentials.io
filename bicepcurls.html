   <br> <p>The biceps curl is a highly recognizable weight-training exercise that works the muscles of the upper arm, and to a lesser extent, those of the lower arm.
        It's a great exercise for seeing results in strength and definition.</p><br>
    <p>There are several variations of this exercise, including those using dumbbells, kettlebells, barbells, resistance bands, or cable machines. Start with the standing 
        alternating dumbbell biceps curl, which you can do anywhere. Curls are a typical exercise used in upper-body strength training routines.</p><br>
    <hr><h3>How to do Standing biceps curls?</h3><br>
    <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/vR1i54EGDIq5WxzLwT4_lNvNQaQ/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2015/03/10/605/n/1922729/570ff954_bicep-curls-Red/i/Bicep-Curl.jpg"  height="250" width="250" class="r1"><br><br>
    <p>Select dumbbells of a weight you can lift 10 times with good form. Suggested starting weights are 5 pounds or 10 pounds per dumbbell. If you are just beginning, 
        rehabilitating from an injury, or returning to exercise after a sedentary period, you might start with 2 pounds.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin standing tall with your feet about hip-width apart. Keep your abdominal muscles engaged.</li> <br>
        <li>Hold one dumbbell in each hand. Let your arms relax down at the sides of your body with palms facing forward.</li> <br>
        <li>Keeping your upper arms stable and shoulders relaxed, bend at the elbow and lift the weights so that the dumbbells approach your shoulders. 
            Your elbows should stay tucked in close to your ribs. Exhale while lifting.</li>   <br>
        <li>Lower the weights to the starting position.</li> <br>
        <li>Do 8-10 curls, then rest and do one or two more sets.</li>  
    </ol><hr>
    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <br><p>Curls work the biceps muscles at the front of the upper arm, and also the muscles of the lower armâ€”the brachialis and brachioradialis.
     You use these muscles anytime you pick something up, which is common throughout daily life. 
    Doing the standing arm curl, you build strength in the upper arm and learn to use your arm muscles correctly, bracing with your core muscles.</p>

    <h3>Common Mistakes</h3><br>
    <p>Get the most out of your biceps curls by avoiding these errors.</p><br>
    <h4>Going too fast</h4><br>
    <p>Concentrate on proper form rather than rapid execution. Lift the weights with a smooth motion, taking as much time to lower the weight as you do to lift it.</p> <br>
    <h4>Improper Elbow Position</h4> <br>
    <p>The position of your elbows should not change during the curl. They should remain close to the side of your body and only the lower arm should move. If you notice your 
        elbows moving away from your torso or floating in front or behind the body, you are probably lifting too much weight.</p><br>
    <h4>Using Momentum</h4><br>
    <p>Don't recruit the shoulders or torso to swing the weights up when doing the dumbbell curl. This can end up feeling like a swinging, twisting, or heaving movement.</p>
    <p>Concentrate on maintaining a tall, upright spine and a tight core. Keep the shoulders relaxed and watch that they don't move forward to initiate the movement. 
        Choose lighter weights or reduce the number of repetitions if this occurs.</p><br>
    <br><HR><h3>Modifications and Variations</h3><br>
    <p>Variations of the curl include seated curls, preacher curls, reverse curls, incline seated curls, and "concentration" curls with your elbow resting on your 
        inner thigh while you are seated. You can also do an alternating hammer curl to add variety to your workout</p> <br>
    <p>To do an alternating hammer curl, start in the same position as a biceps curl, but the palms should face the midline of the body (so your thumbs are facing forward).</p> 
    <ol>
        <li>Bending at the elbow, lift one dumbbell toward your shoulder, rotating your arm as it moves up so that the palm with the dumbbell faces up during the movement and eventually faces the shoulder.</li><br>
        <li>Lower the weight to the starting position and perform the same movement with the other arm.</li><br>
        <li>Continue to alternate until the set is complete.</li> 
    </ol>
    <p>A barbell, cable machine, or resistance bands can also be used similarly for curl exercises. You can use these variations to challenge your biceps in different ways.</p> <br>
    <hr><h3>Safety and Precautions</h3> <br>
    <p>This exercise is generally recommended for most people. But if you have an arm injury or experience pain during the motion, do not continue. You can expect to feel fatigue and even burning in your 
        biceps and forearm muscles after a few lifts, and this is desired to get your muscles to strengthen and grow. However, do not force extra repetitions once you are unable to do the curls with good form. Take a rest before doing the next set.</p><br>
    <p>Don't lift too heavy a weight to begin with, and stop if you feel any pain. Building big biceps is popular, but don't rush to get to heavier weights before you're ready. Injury to the elbow or wrist can occur, 
        and that'll put a damper on your entire workout routine.</p><br>
