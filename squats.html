    <p>Most strength-training routines, especially those designed for runners, will include squats and variations of the squat.
         It's one of our main movement patterns as humans—one we perform every time we sit down and get up from a chair.</p><br>
    <p>Squats are a functional exercise that benefit your joint and muscle health, as well as your posture—all of which are important 
        for improving your running form and speed.</p> <br>
    <p>The squat also happens to build muscles you need for a strong, powerful stride, including the quads, glutes, hamstrings, and your core.
         So it's smart to incorporate this move into your workout schedule to help round out your training. The most important thing, though, 
         is learning how to do squats properly.</p> <br>
    <p>Here, your guide to mastering a squat, including common mistakes, and variations that add a new challenge to your workouts.</p><br>
    <hr><h3>How To Do Squats Properly</h3> <br>

    <h4>The Set-Up:</h4> <br>
    <p>Stance will vary slightly from person to person, but your feet should be between hip- and shoulder-width distance apart,
         with your toes slightly turned out (between 5 and 15 degrees). Your spine should be neutral, shoulders back and down, chest open and tall.
          Make sure you keep your heels down and planted throughout the entire move. You can clasp hands in front of chest for balance.</p><br>
    <h4>The Squat:</h4><br>
    <p>Initiate the movement by sending the hips back as if you're sitting back into an invisible chair. Bend knees to lower down as far as possible 
        with chest lifted in a controlled movement. Keep lower back neutral. Press through heels to stand back up to the starting position. Repeat</p><br>
    <p>Aim to get thighs at least parallel to the floor. To do this, squat down so your thighs are even with your knees. If mobility allows, lower further. 
        As you come back up, make sure hips are set right under your ribs—you don't want your hips to pull too far back.</p><br>
    <hr><h3>Common Mistakes People Make When Doing Squats</h3> <br>
    <p>Sacrificing form can lead to injury and will make the move ineffective. Common mistakes seen include:</p>    
    <ul>
        <li>heels lifting off the ground, shifting the weight onto the toes—this often happens if you start the moves by bending the knees, rather than sending the hips back</li> <br>
        <li>allowing the chest to fall forward</li><br>
        <li>curving the upper body and spine, creating a hunchback</li><br>
        <li>losing the neutral spine position in the lower back, particularly at the bottom of the exercise if you're going low (often called the “butt wink”)</li> <br>
        <li>standing with feet too wide or too narrow</li> <br>
        <li>not controlling the movement or rushing through reps</li><br>
        <li>allowing the knees to cave in instead of keeping them tracking over toes</li><br>
        <li>not going deep enough by stopping with knees at a 90-degree bend</li>
    </ul>
    <hr><h3>What are the benefits of squats?</h3><br>
    <p>Squatting is one of the most functional movements you can do. It's great for the health of joints, creating strength, improving posture, and requires a lot of core work. 
        A bodyweight squat engages your core, mobilizes your hips, knees, and ankles, and builds strength in your glutes, quads, and hamstrings. Plus, you can do a bodyweight squat anywhere.</p><br>
    <hr><h3>How often should you do squats?</h3><br>
    <p>It depends on what your goal is. If you're looking to build endurance, you should do 3 to 4 sets of at least 12 reps. You'll want to adjust your reps per set if you want to build muscle—aim for 8 to 12 reps with weight. And if you're looking to build maximum strength, do no more than 6 reps with a heavy weight.</p><br>
    <p>The same goes for frequency: If you're building endurance with bodyweight squats or lighter weights, you can perform the move more frequently as it's not as taxing on muscles and you don't need as much recovery. You can do bodyweight squats 3 to 4 times a week. even more if you want.</p><br>
    <p>If you're focusing on strength-building, using heavy weights will put more strain on your muscles. So, if you're incorporating weighted squats, this can vary between 2 to 3 times a week. You'll want ample recovery time, so you don't cause injury from overtraining.</p>
