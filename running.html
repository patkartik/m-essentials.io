    <p>Whether you're an experienced runner or just starting out, these nine tips will help you tweak your form to perfection: </p>
    <br><h4>1. Look ahead</h4>
    <br><p>While it may be tempting to observe passing scenery on your run, it's best to keep your eyes on the prize. </p>
    <br><p>"Try to keep looking towards the horizon and keep your chin parallel to the ground," says Watson. "This helps keep your head in a neutral position, minimizing the strain on your neck."</p>

    <h4>2. Keep your shoulders down and back </h4> <br>
    <p>Hunching your shoulders can trigger neck stiffness, rotator cuff injuries, and muscle soreness. That's why it's important to roll your shoulders back and down, and try to keep them loose. </p> <br>
    <p>"Some runners have to consciously pause and lower their shoulders to remove any tension in the area," Watson says. </p><br>
    <h4>3. Swing your arms from the shoulder</h4> <br>
    <p>The way you swing your arms while you run also matters. Alexis Colvin, MD, an orthopedic sports medicine surgeon at Mount Sinai Hospital, says you should swing your arms from front to back rather than side to side. This will make your stride more efficient. </p> <br>
    <p>The American Council on Exercise recommends running with your elbows bent at a 90 degree angle, noting that if your arms cross your torso when you're running, that's a waste of energy that will cause you to get tired faster.</p> <br>
    <h4>4. Relax your hands </h4><br>
    <p>"Keep your hands gently curled up, but not in a tight fist," Watson says. Holding them out flat or in a fist can create tension in your arms and shoulders. It also is less efficient, as you will spend extra energy contracting your arm muscles. </p><br>
    <h4>5. Tighten your core</h4> <br>
    <p>Core strength is linked to improved balance and stability, both of which play into running efficiency and proper form. Your core also acts as a "shock absorber", promoting ease of movement and unloading extra force on your joints. </p><br>
    <p>As you're running, imagine that you are pulling your belly button back towards your spine. This will engage your core, and ensure you're staying upright. </p><br>
    <h4>6. Make sure your torso is strong and upright</h4> <br>
    <p>Ensure that your back is straight and your torso is upright â€” this will help with breathing, as good posture can help the diaphragm expand and contract fully. The diaphragm is the muscle responsible 
        for inflating and deflating your lungs. Giving it adequate space to suck in oxygen means you're less likely to be out of breath. </p> <br>
    <h4>7. Don't bounce</h4> <br>
    <p>Bouncing too high when you run means your body lands with more force, necessitating your joints to absorb more shock which can cause knee injuries. To combat this, try to propel yourself forward rather than upwards when you run.</p> <br>
    <h4>8. Align your lower body</h4> <br>
    <p>While a long stride may mean you run further, don't overextend your knees. When your foot makes contact with the ground, your knee should be slightly bent and in line with the middle of your foot, says Watson. This helps joints absorb shock.  </p><br>
    <p>The ideal height to bring your knees up to varies. Sprinters often raise their knees high for maximum power, but this can waste energy when you are running long distances. </p><br>
    <h4>9. Land lightly</h4> <br>
    <p>To avoid injury, try not to slap your feet on the ground. Instead, keep footfalls light and quiet. </p> <br>
