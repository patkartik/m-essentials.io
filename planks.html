    <br><h3>What Is a Plank?</h3><br>
    <p>A plank is an isometric exercise that involves contracting your core muscles while remaining in a static position. Perform planks by getting on all fours, placing your feet hip-width apart, 
        and keeping your neck in a neutral position. While maintaining a strong core, lift yourself up onto your feet and forearms. Keep your legs and back in a straight line for the duration of the plank exercise.</p><br>
    <hr><h3>How to Do a Plank With Perfect Form</h3><br>
    <p>For the plank, begin by performing 2-3 sets of 30-60 seconds. Choose your sets and hold duration based on your ability to maintain good technique throughout each set.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Get into the modified plank position by placing your forearms in contact with the floor. Your hips should be off the ground with your knees and toes in contact with the ground. Your elbows should be directly underneath your shoulders.</li><br>
        <li>Rotate shoulders outward to engage your lats and pull your forearms toward your midsection to create tension.</li><br>
        <li>Tuck your pelvis, and squeeze your glutes and quads.</li><br>
        <li>Engage your core. Your chin should remain tucked throughout the movement, as if you were holding an egg under your chin. All repetitions should begin from this position.</li><br>
        <li>While maintaining your alignment, straighten your legs to lift your knees off of the ground so you end up in a full plank position. Your legs should be hip-width apart.</li><br>
        <li>Continue to engage your core and maintain full body tension.</li><br>
        <li>Hold the plank for your desired length of time.</li>
    </ol>

    <hr><h3>Benefits of Doing Planks</h3><br>
    <p>Consider some of the benefits of regularly doing planks.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Planks increase your core strength. </b>The plank is an effective core exercise that activates abdominal muscles like the rectus abdominis and transverse abdominis.</li><br>
        <li><b>Planks work muscle groups throughout your entire body. </b>Planks are a whole-body exercise, engaging muscles in your legs like the hamstrings and quadriceps, muscles in your back like the rhomboids and trapezius, and muscles in your arms like the triceps.</li><br>
        <li><b>Planks can improve your posture. </b>With proper form and regular practice, planks can improve your posture by engaging stabilizer muscles in your core and lower back.</li><br>
        <li><b>Planks are a versatile bodyweight exercise. </b>You can practice several plank variations at home. Although the traditional forearm plank is a great place to start, try the side plank to work your 
            obliques or the high plank with your arms extended in a push-up position. For another advanced variation, lift one leg off the floor while doing planks.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr><h3>How to Work out Safely and Avoid Injury</h3><br>
    <p>If you have a previous or pre-existing health condition, consult your physician before beginning an exercise program. Proper exercise technique is essential to ensure the safety and effectiveness of an exercise program, but you may need to modify each exercise to attain 
        optimal results based on your individual needs. Always select a weight that allows you to have full control of your body throughout the movement. When performing any exercise, pay close attention to your body, and stop immediately if you note pain or discomfort.</p><br>
    <p>In order to see continual progress and build body strength, incorporate proper warm-ups, rest, and nutrition into your exercise program. Your results will ultimately be based on your ability to adequately recover from your workouts. 
        Rest for 24 to 48 hours before training the same muscle groups to allow sufficient recovery.</p><hr>
