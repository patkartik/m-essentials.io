    <h3>The Benefits of High Knees</h3>
    <p>There's a reason you did high knees in your high school gym! High Knee is a great move to use as a warm-up to a run or as part of a high-intensity interval training routine—it just depends on how high you lift your knees and how fast you go!  Here are just a few benefits of this convenient total-body exercise:</p><br>
    <h4>It's A Cardio Boost</h4>
    <p>You can choose the effort you put into your High Knees, but no matter how you do them, you will get a great cardio workout. If you are warming up or just beginning to exercise, keep your knees a bit lower and go slower.</p>
    <p>If you want higher intensity and can go harder, lift the knees higher and go faster. Of course, anything in between is also great!</p>
    <br><h4>Works Your Lower Body And Core</h4>
    <p>Your legs are moving and getting stronger with High Knees. This move is simply running fast in place, and we know that running is an excellent exercise for your legs!</p>
    <p>To get your knees higher, you must also engage your core muscles, so High Knees is suitable for training your core strength.</p><br>
    <h4>No Equipment Needed</h4>
    <p>The cardio benefits listed are excellent but even better is that you can do this move right at home. There is no need to go to a gym or head into bad weather, no need to use dumbbells, kettlebells, or a stability ball; just find some space and get moving with your own body.</p><br>
    <h4>What Muscles Do High Knees Work?</h4>
    <p>High Knees is an excellent cardio exercise that works your legs and core while giving you a tremendous cardiovascular move that gets your heart rate up anytime, anywhere. </p>
    <p>If you've already been incorporating high knees into your workout routine, then consider switching them up with other high knee equivalents that can target similar muscles, such as Steam Engine, High Knee March, Butt Kicks, and Power Skips!</p><br>
    <h4>How Many Calories Do High Knees Burn?</h4>
    <p>People often ask how many calories they are burning in their workouts. While we wish it were as simple as saying certain exercises burn a specific amount of calories, it generally boils down to how hard you're working.</p>
    <p>Just keep your intensity up and make sure you are breathing through your mouth. Bottom line—the harder you work, the more calories you burn.</p>
