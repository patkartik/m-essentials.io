    <p>Sidestepping is a skill that can be learned and practiced. A good sidestep is all about timing and selling a deception.</p>
    <p>However, rapidly changing direction is also an intense physical activity. You need to be able to turn forward momentum into lateral momentum and may even need to sidestep in two different directions to shimmy past a tackle. Rapid changes of direction require lots of strength and power - especially when you are running at top speed.</p><br><hr>
    <h3>How to perform side steps â€¦</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab a small loop band, start with a lighter one at first to get a feel for the exercise.</li>
        <li>Step through the band with both feet, pull it up until its just above the knees, and adjust it until it's as comfortable as a rubber band that's squeezing your legs together can be. You may want to sit while setting this up, in order to avoid losing your balance and falling - trust me, it happens. You can also place the band around the ankles, this might be a little more difficult, and it won't give you the same feed back that many people need to make sure their knees aren't caving inward.</li>
        <li>Position yourself, standing on the floor, in a semi-squatted position - like an athletic ready position. Feet around shoulder width apart, knees pushing outwardly into the band, butt pushed backward slightly (seated back). Your core should be engaged. Your glutes may feel this a bit alr</li>
        <li>Keep the knees pushing outwardly into the band, press into the floor with your left foot using it to push yourself to the right, step wider than shoulder width apart with your right foot.</li>
        <li>Once your right foot hits the ground, your stance should be wider than shoulder width apart. With control, step the left foot towards the right brining it back to a shoulder width stance - your starting position. You should have taken one large side step, all while keeping your butt seated back and your knees slightly bent. You should feel this in your glutes.</li>
        <li>Continue on like this, in a side stepping motion for 5-10 steps towards the right. Then reverse and walk 5 - 10 steps towards the left. Work up to 3 rounds of this with the band of your choice, before moving up to a heavier band or more steps.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Be sure to keep constant tension on the band by pressing the knees outward into the band. Do not break your semi-squatted position during your stepping, keep your hips seated back and a slight bend in the knees. Never let the feet come in any closer than shoulder width apart, your steps should be wide.</p>
