    <p>Any activity that you do for more than a few minutes at a time is aerobic training.When you're doing this type of exercise, your body uses your aerobic energy system for power. And, because that metabolic system uses oxygen to help create energy, your breathing rate increases, Bernard explains.</p><br>
    <p>Some popular types of aerobic exercise include:</p>
    <ul>

        <li><a href="dancing.html">Aerobic Dancing</a></li>
        <li><a href="link">Walking</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>It doesn't matter all that much what you do, as long as you do it regularly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week.</p>

    <br><h4>Aerobic Intervals</h4><br>
    <p>Alternatively, you can do at least 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise. When doing high-intensity exercise, alternate periods of work and rest. For example, sprint for 30 seconds and recover at a jog for one minute; then repeat.</p>

   <p>Getting your heart rate higher in those intervals may help you reap more benefits than possible with the same amount of steady-state aerobic activity, according to a 2015 study in the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine. You can do intervals on the treadmill, track or bike, and when in the pool or jumping rope.</p><br><br><br>
