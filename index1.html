        Building muscle matters. In fact, your strength and muscle health 
        are leading factors in longevity, according to July 2020 research in BMJ.
    </p><br>
    <p>That's because doing activities that strengthen and build lean, 
        active muscle can help reduce the risk of chronic disease, improve mobility and function and protect brain health.

    <h3>Weight-Bearing Exercise</h3> <br>
    <p>Any activity in which you hold yourself up against gravity (eg: you stand up during the move) is a weight-bearing exercise. While some of the most popular weight-bearing activities are associated with doing aerobic exercise (more on this later), they also include many of the best strength moves.</p><br>

    <h3>Non-Weight-Bearing Exercise</h3> <br>
    <p>These types of exercises place less stress on the joints and can be helpful for anyone with joint issues and mobility restrictions. Strength machines, while they can be good for training around and rehabbing injuries, are especially great for helping athletes isolate specific muscles.</p><br>

    <h3>Calisthenics</h3> <br>
    <p>Whenever you're using your own body weight as resistance, you're doing calisthenics. Think push-ups, squats and mountain climbers. One of the biggest benefits of calisthenics is their convenience. You can do them anywhere without any fancy equipment.</p><br>
    <p>They're ideal for beginners because they help you learn movement patterns and build functional strength that's needed to graduate to using weights.</p><br>

    <h3>Wieghtlifting</h3> <br>
    <p>Lifting weights is the ultimate strength-building exercise.From triceps kickbacks with 5-pound dumbbells to Olympic lifts with 500 pounds on a barbell, weight training looks different for everyone. The type of weightlifting you do depends on your goals.</p>
