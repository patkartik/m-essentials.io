    <p>Fast feet is a conditioning exercise that will also increase your speed and agility. In this guide, we not only reveal how to do this exercise but also provide you with some cool variations and alternatives.</p>
    <p>
        Whatever your fitness goal is, metabolic conditioning (metcon) training will help you get there sooner. Metcon develops fitness, increases muscular endurance, improves your recovery ability, and can help you lose weight and get leaner, too.</p>
    <p>
        There are several different ways to incorporate metcon into your workout routine, including circuit training and HIIT. However, it's also helpful to have a library of metcon exercises to call on so that your workouts are never boring.
    </p>
    <p>In this guide, we take a look at fast feet, explaining why and how to do this exercise, and reveal some of the best fast feet variations and alternatives.</p><br><hr>
    <h3>Fast Feet - Muscles Worked</h3>
    <p>Fast feet is a cardio exercise and, as such, uses lots of different muscle groups. None of these muscles are particularly overloaded, so doing fast feet won't lead to notable increases in size or strength. However, supplying the muscles involved in fast feet with oxygenated blood will increase your heart and breathing rate, which is the primary purpose of this exercise.</p>
    <p>The main muscles involved in fast feet are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gastrocnemius and soleus</li>
        <li>Quadriceps</li>
        <li>Hamstrings</li>
        <li>Gluteus maximus</li>
        <li>Abductors</li>
        <li>Adductors</li>
    </ul><hr>
    <h3>How to Do Fast Feet</h3><br>
    <p>Get more from fast feet while keeping your risk of injury to a minimum by following these guidelines:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Adopt an athletic stance with your knees slightly bent and feet about shoulder-width apart. Lean forward slightly from your hips.</li><br>
        <li>Rise up onto your toes and then run in place as fast as you can. Keep your hips low and your feet relatively close to the ground so you can move them as quickly as possible.</li><br>
        <li>Pump your arms in time with your feet, keeping your movements relatively small.</li><br>
        <li>Continue for the prescribed duration, e.g., 30 seconds, or number of repetitions, e.g., 50.</li>
    </ol><hr>
    <h3>Fast Feet Benefits and Drawbacks</h3><br>
    <p>Not sure whether fast feet are worth adding to your metcon workouts? Check out these benefits:</p><br>
    <p><b>No equipment required </b>- cardio exercises don't come much more convenient than fast feet. They require no equipment and very little space, so you can do them almost anywhere and anytime. They are the perfect excuse-free metcon exercise.</p><br>
    <p><b>Good for speed and agility </b>- as well as being a good cardio/metcon exercise, doing fast feet could increase your speed and agility. That's why you'll often see athletes doing this exercise. If you play sports, especially those involving sprinting or rapid direction changes, doing fast feet may improve your performance.</p><br>
    <p><b>Easy to learn </b>- if you can jog on the spot, you can probably do fast feet. Compared to things like burpees and box jumps, fast feet are pretty simple. If you are new to this exercise, start off at a comfortable pace, and speed up as you get used to it. It's a self-regulating exercise that is suitable for beginner, intermediate, and advanced exercisers.</p><br>
    <p><b>Calf injuries </b>- fast feet involved a rapid loading and unloading of your calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus). If you are unused to things like jumping and sprinting, and even if you train your calves regularly, this could result in calf muscle or Achilles tendon injuries. Minimize your risk of injury by introducing this exercise gradually into your workouts.</p><br>
    <p><b>Limited overload </b>- as you get fitter, you may find that this exercise is no longer hard enough to develop your fitness further.</p><br><hr>
    <h3>Fast Feet Variations and Alternatives</h3><br>
    <p>Fast feet is a highly effective metcon exercise, but that doesn't mean you need to do it all the time. There are several variations and alternatives you can use to keep your workouts productive and interesting:</p><br>
    <h4>1. March or jog in place</h4>
    <p>The aim of fast feet is to pump your legs and arms as quickly as you can. However, if that's a bit too tough for you at the moment, try marching in place instead. Just walk on the spot, lifting your knees and swinging your arms. Keep your torso upright - don't lean back!</p>
    <p>Once you're are comfortable marching in place, try jogging on the spot instead. This increases foot speed and impact, preparing your muscles for fast feet.</p><br>
    <h4>2. In and outs</h4>
    <p>In and outs are a variation of fast feet. They involve more coordination and agility and also increase abductor and adductor engagement. Start slow and increase your speed as you get used to the additional movement.</p>
    <b class="bold">How to do it:</b>   
    <ol>
        <li>Adopt an athletic stance with your knees slightly bent and feet about shoulder-width apart. Lean forward slightly from your hips</li>
        <li>Run in place as fast as you can, pumping your arms in time with your legs.</li>
        <li>As you run, bring your feet together for two steps, and then take your feet apart for two steps.</li>
        <li>Continue alternating ins and outs for the duration of your set.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>3. Speed step-ups</h4>
    <p>Speed step-ups increase the agility demand of fast feet. They also involve some travel and a change of height. This makes them a little more demanding in terms of coordination. Use a low step so you can maintain a rapid foot speed. A higher step will force you to slow down, somewhat defeating the aim of the exercise.</p>
    <b class="bold">How to do it:</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Stand facing a low step, e.g., 4 to 6-inches. Start doing fast feet, remembering to pump your arms.</li>
        <li>Maintaining your foot speed, step up and off your platform. Lead with the same leg for all your reps.</li>
        <li>est a moment, and then do your next set leading with the opposite leg.</li>
        <li>You can also do this exercise astride your box.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>4. Jump rope</h4>
    <p>If you can jump rope, try combining it with fast feet. See how many jumps you can do in 30 or 60 seconds, pumping your legs as fast as you can in the process. Trying to turn a jump rope quickly increases upper body muscle engagement and will improve your agility and coordination.</p>
    <p>However, even if you are an experienced rope jumper and fast footer, you probably won't come close to the world record of 228 jumps in 30 seconds, currently held by this Chinese teenager!</p><br>
