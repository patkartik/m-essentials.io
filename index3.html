    <p>Agility is the ability to move quickly and easily, but this type of fitness training isn't just for athletes. It also helps prevent falls and injuries by improving your reflexes, coordination and focus, according to the ACE.</p>
    <p>In everyday life, it's being able to avoid an object before you trip over it or hop out of the way when your fellow gym-goer almost drops a weight on your foot.</p>
    <p>Agility training can be an entire workout on its own that also builds endurance and strength. Or you can add a few agility exercises to your strength and cardio workouts.</p>
